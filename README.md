# Mattermost-ChatGPT

This application is designed to interface Mattermost, a team messaging software, with ChatGPT, a language processing model developed by OpenAI. It uses the Mattermost API to send messages to a specific channel and the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a response to a given prompt.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A Mattermost instance with an incoming webhook URL
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install openai requests

3. Set up the environment variables for your Mattermost and OpenAI API keys.
4. Run the script using python:

python script_name.py

5. You can also schedule regular execution of the script using a task scheduler such as cron (Linux/Unix) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

## Configuration

The following parameters can be configured in the script:

- `MATTERMOST_URL`: The incoming webhook URL for your Mattermost instance
- `CHANNEL`: The channel to post the message to
- `PROMPT`: The prompt to send to GPT-3
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

## Usage

Once the script is running, it will send the configured prompt to GPT-3 to generate a response, which will then be sent to the specified Mattermost channel via the Mattermost API. This allows Mattermost users to ask questions or interact with GPT-3 using team messaging.

Please note that this application is just an example of what can be done with the Mattermost and OpenAI APIs, there are many other ways to use these APIs to create custom applications. It is also important to configure the API keys and settings for your own Mattermost installation and OpenAI account.
